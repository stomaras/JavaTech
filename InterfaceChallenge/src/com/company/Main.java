    // Create a simple interface that allows an obect to be saved to some sort of storage medium.
    // Implement the following:
        // 1. ISaveable(interface)
        // - it has two methods:
        //   - write(), takes no arguments and returns a List containing objects of type String
        //   - read(), takes a List of type String and does not return anything.
        // 2. Player Class
        // - it has four fields. Two String's called name and weapon. Two int's called hitPoints and strength.
        // - A constructor that accepts a String(name) and two int's (hitPoints and Strength). It initialises name
        //   hitPoints and strength with the newly passed in values. It initialises weapon with the default weapon
        //   "Sword".
        //   and eleven methods :
        //                          - Getters and Setters for all four fields.
        //                          - write(), same as interface.Return a List of the fields in the order they appear
        //                            in toString().
        //                          - read(), same as interface.Store the values in the List, in the order they appear
        //                            in toString().Make sure the List is not null and the size is greater than 0 before
        //                            storing the values.
        //                          - toString(), Player s overriding toString() method. It takes no arguments and returns a String
        //                            in the following format: Player{name='Tim', hitPoints=10, strength=10, weapon='Sword'}
        // 3. Monster class
        // - it has three fields. One String called name and two int's called hitPoints and strength.
        // - A constructor that accepts a String(name) and two int's (hitPoints and strength).It initialises name, hitPoints and
        //   strength with the newly passed in values.
        // - and six methods:
        //   - Only getters for the three fields.
        //   - write(), same as interface. Return a List of the fields in the order they appear in toString().
        //   - read(), same as interface. Store the values in the List, in the order they appear in toString().
        //     Make sure the List is not null and the size() is greater than 0 before storing the values.
        //   - toString(), Monsters() overriding toString() method. It takes no arguments and returns a String
        //     in the following format: Monster{name="Werewolf", hitPoints=20, strength=40}.
