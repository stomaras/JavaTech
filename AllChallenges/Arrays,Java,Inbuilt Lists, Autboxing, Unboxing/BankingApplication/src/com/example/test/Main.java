        1. Bank
        - It has two fields , A String called name and an ArrayList that holds
          objects of type Branch called branches.
        - A constructor that takes a String (name of the bank). It initialises name and
          instantiates branches.
        - And five methods, they are ( their functions are in their names):

          - addBranch(), has one parameter of type String(name of the branch)
            and returns a boolean.It returns true if the branch was added successfully
            or false otherwise.
          - addCustomer(), has three parameters of type String (name of the branch),
            String (name of the customer), double (initial transaction) and returns a boolean.
            It returns true if the customer was added successfully or false otherwise.
          - addCustomerTransaction(), has three parameters of type String(name of the branch)
            . String(name of the customer), double(transaction) and returns a boolean. It returns
            true if the customers transaction was added successfully or false otherwise.
          - findBranch(), has one parameter of type String(name of the Branch) and returns a Branch.
            Return the Branch if it exists or null otherwise.
          - listCustomers(), has two parameters of type String(name of the Branch), boolean (print transactions)
            and returns a boolean. Return true if the branch exists or false otherwise. This method prints out a list
            of customers.
===========================================================================================================
        2. Branch
        - It has two fields, A String called name and an ArrayList that holds objects of type Customer called
          customers.
        - A constructor that takes a String(name of the branch). It initialises name and instantiates customers.
        - And five methods, they are (their functions are in their names):
            - getName(), getter for name.
            - getCustomers(), getter for customers.
            - newCustomer(), has two parameters of type String(name of customer), double(initial transaction)
              and returns a boolean. Returns true if the customer was added successfully or false otherwise.
            - addCustomerTransaction(), has two parameters of type String (name of customer),
              double (transaction) and returns a boolean. Returns true if the customers transaction was added
              successfully or false otherwise.
            - findCustomer(), has one parameter of type String(name of customer) and returns a Customer.
              Return the Customer if they exist, null otherwise.

        3. Customer
        - It has two fields, A String called name and an ArrayList that holds objects of type
          Double called transactions.
        - A constructor that takes a String(name of customer) and a double(initial transaction).It
          initialises name and instantiates transactions.
        - And three methods, they are (their functions are in their names):
            - getName(), getter for name.
            - getTransactions(), getter for transactions.
            - addTransaction(), has one parameter of type double(transaction) and does not return anything.
