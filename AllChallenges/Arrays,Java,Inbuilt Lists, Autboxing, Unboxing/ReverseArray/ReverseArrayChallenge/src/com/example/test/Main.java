        Reverse Array

        Write a method called reverse() with an int array as a parameter.
        The method should not return any value. In other words, the method is allowed to modify
        the array parameter.

        To reverse the array, you have to swap the elements, so that the first element is swapped
        with the last element and so on.

        For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the reversed array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

        The method should first print out the newely passed in array as Array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        and then once it's been reversed, print it out sa Reversed array = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

        TIP: The method should be defined as private static
        NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
