	In this exercise you will create one class and name it Printer. This class will have two member variables of type
	int, tonerLevel and pagesPrinted, and one of type boolean called duplex. All three fields will have private access
	. The constructor will accept two of these variables, tonerLevel and duplex, as parameters following these rules:
	    - tonerLevel: must be greater than -1 but less than or equal to 100. If it does not meet these conditions
	      then it should be initialized to -1.
	    - duplex: should be initialized to the value of the parameter.
