        // something without actually implementing the details. In other words
        // we are focusing on what needs to be done, not on the how it's to be done
        // So interface is, as you saw are purely abstract and they do not specify any actual
        // aspect of the implementation. The actual implementation was left to the classes that implement
        // the interface, and that's why we use the word implements when we are using an interface
        // Interface defines what is need to be done. It does not define how it's done.
        // The how, we actually  have to go into the class, in this case Monster and
        // implements the Isaveable interface
        //
        // Abstract classes provide methods but do not provide an implementation
        // of those methods. You can also inherit from an class itself
