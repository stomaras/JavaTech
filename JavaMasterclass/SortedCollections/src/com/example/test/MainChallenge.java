    /*
    Modify the program so that adding items to the shopping basket does not
    actually reduce the stock count but, instead, reserves the requested number
    of items.

    You will need to add a "reserved" field to the StockItem class to store
    the number of items reserved.

    Items can continue to be added to the basket, but it should not be possible to
    reserve more than the available stock of any item. An item's available stock
    is the stock count less the reserved amount.

    The stock count for each item is reduced when a basket is checked out, at which
    point all reserved items in the basket have their actual stock count reduced.

    Once checkout is complete, the contents of the basket are cleared.

    It should also be possible to "Unreverse" items that were added to the basket
    by mistake.

    The program should prevent any attempt to unreverse more items than were reversed fora
    a basket.
