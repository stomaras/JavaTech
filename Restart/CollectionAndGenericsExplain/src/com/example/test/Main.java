        // in Set Interface you don't have duplicate values
        // in List you traverse numbers in sequence access
        // in Set Interface you have random access in elements
        // in TreeSet you have access in sequence order.
        // We have a lot of interfaces a lot of classes in a big collection API
        // In a List interface we can have duplicate elements and every element
        // will have a unique index number.
        // Map will not have a number will have a key Map<k,v> , for every value
        // will have a key, the key can be a number it can be a string it can be anything
        // Map is also an interface now we have to search for that class which implements
        // that interface and that class is HashMap
        // We have two class here which implements Map Interface. One is HashMap and second
        // is HashTable, one is synchronized one is not you can go for a thread safe implementation
        // or a non thread safe implementation.
